A demo video that shows off my scary story anthology, Scary Stories About Camping. The goal of the site is to serve as am anthology of creepy stories about camping, hiking, the woods, etc.

I built the website in the PHP framework Laravel. In addition to the website, I built a Chrome browser extension that will allow me to easily capture stories that I read.
